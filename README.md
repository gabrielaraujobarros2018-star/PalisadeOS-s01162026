# PalisadeOS-s01162026
PalisadeOS s01162026 finalizes a complete system build with unified boot options and recovery environments across ARM64 and x86_64. It enforces single-entry boot discipline, deterministic freestanding builds, and stable recovery paths. The project continues, but this build is complete.
