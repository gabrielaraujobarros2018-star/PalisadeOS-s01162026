# DeviceName Configuration Handling — PalisadeOS

PalisadeOS does not ship with predefined or hardcoded Device Name configuration files.
This is an intentional design decision aligned with the project’s goals of transparency,
inspectability, and hardware-driven identity rather than vendor-locked defaults.

All device identification configuration must be explicitly provided by the user or
system integrator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration Location
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Users are required to place Device Name–related configuration files in the following
directory:

    /palisade/os/etc/

This directory is treated as authoritative at both early userspace initialization
and late kernel runtime. No fallback or autogenerated device identity will be used
if configuration files are missing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Accepted Configuration Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following files are recognized when present:

    /palisade/os/etc/device.ini
    /palisade/os/etc/device.cfg

Both formats may coexist. If both are present, precedence is resolved as follows:

    1. device.cfg  (highest priority; parsed first)
    2. device.ini  (fallback if values are missing)

Conflicting keys are resolved deterministically in favor of device.cfg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Boot-Time Behavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------

During the early boot phase:

    - Firmware or bootloader mounts the PalisadeOS root.
    - The kernel or early init process reads /palisade/os/etc/.
    - Device identity is loaded verbatim from user-supplied configuration.
    - Optional device verifier logic (if enabled) validates architecture, class,
      and device identifiers against detected hardware.

If no valid Device Name configuration is found:

    - PalisadeOS enters a restricted state.
    - Device identity is reported as "UNIDENTIFIED".
    - Secure boot paths may refuse to continue depending on policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Design Rationale
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This approach ensures:

    - No implicit device branding.
    - Full user control over system identity.
    - Compatibility with mixed targets (desktop and mobile).
    - Deterministic, inspectable boot behavior.
    - No vendor or build-time assumptions baked into the OS image.

Device identity in PalisadeOS is declarative, not inferred.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Security Note
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Because these files influence system identity and verification:

    - They should be protected with appropriate filesystem permissions.
    - Tampering may trigger verifier halt or recovery mode.
    - Immutable flags may be applied after deployment if supported.
